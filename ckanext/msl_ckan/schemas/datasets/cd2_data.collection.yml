dataset_fields:

# standard CKAN field
- field_name: title
  label: Title of the data collection
  preset: title
  form_placeholder: eg. A descriptive title

# DH: added alternate title
- field_name: wave_alternate_title
  label:  Alternate title of the wave
  
# standard CKAN field
# name is an internal CKAN identifier;
# if the cohort has a DOI then possibly use hash of this
# DH: perhaps skip "name" as we already have "title", or replace title with name?

# WAVE LEVEL METADATA

- field_name: wave
  label: wave
  repeating_subfields:
  - field_name: wave_title
    label: Short identifying title of the wave
  # DH: measurement stage is not in the metadata model, corresponds with Universe
  #- field_name: wave_measurement_stages # e.g. 1 month, 3 months, etc; can we somehow harmonize these accross cohorts? 
  #  label: Stage of measurement (e.g., target age of participants in the wave)
  - field_name: notes # standard CKAN field; abstract description of the wave
    label: Short description of the wave (Abstract)
  - field_name: wave_universe # textual description of universe; redundant with description field available?
    label: Short summary of the participants in the cohort (e.g., target age) 
  - field_name: wave_publisher_name
    label: Name of organization hosting the wave data (e.g. university, library, repository, etc.)
    required: true
  - field_name: wave_publisher_identifier
    label: Identifier of the organization hosting the wave data
  - field_name: wave_publisher_identifier_type
    label: Type of organization identifier for publisher of the wave data
  # DH: This info is contained within Universe (was included in older model versions)
  #- field_name: wave_lifestage
  #  label: Life stage
  # DH: SpatialCoverage consists of CountryCode, GeographicLocationReference and Lowest/Higest
  #     reference in the metadata model. I guess these will be collapsed into 1?
  - field_name: wave_geo_location # textual, no coordinates
    label: Geographical coverage
  - field_name: wave_start_date_collection
    label: Start date of wave collection
  - field_name: wave_end_date_collection
    label: End date of wave collection
  - field_name: dc_wave_coverage # note the prefix and see the model: this is actually a field that applies to a single measurement
    label: Coverage percentage of the measurement for this wave
  # DH: added Physical data product
  - field_name: wave_physical_data_product
    label: Documents the physical structure of the data produced by the study unit, e.g., digital files, biomedical samples, etc.
    
  # - field_name: wave_creators
    #   removed for wave level because these are included with the data collection itself
    # - field_name: wave_contributors
    #   removed for wave level because these are included with the data collection itself

  # Is this actually necessary? Don't think so...:
  # DH: I think it is worth adding here, you never know if a specific wave is funded.
   - field_name: wave_funding # can be distinct for different waves
       label: Funding for this wave
       repeating_subfields:
       - field_name: wave_funder
